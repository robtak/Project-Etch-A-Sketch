This is a project base on the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery">Java Script and jQuary section</a> of the The Odin Project. The project in this section is basically to test my competence and understanding I have gain from all that I have been learning untill this point.

I have created a sketch pad with circles. When a user hovers on the the circle, the circle changes color drawing a path for where for the users mouse movement on the grid. 

The stetch pad is by default loaded with 16px circle repeating 16 times vertically and horizontally. 

The user can click on the (+) icon to create a new sketch grid of any size in a range between 16 and 64. Note: The higher your sketch grid size, the smaller your grid circles.

When the pencil icon is clicked, the user can hover on anywhere on the sketch grid to draw a pathen.

When the ereaser icon is clicked, the user can hover over a circle to change the color back to the initial color.

When the (X) is clicked, the user clear all circles whose color changed as a result of the hover effect back to the default grid circle color.
